                                             A Quiz Application With Python
In this project, I build A Quiz Application Using Python Language for the terminal. The word quiz was first used in 1781 to mean eccentric person. Nowadays, it’s mostly used to describe short tests of trivia or expert knowledge with questions.
This Application is build to test a person’s expertise on a range of topics. You can use this project to strengthen your own knowledge or to challenge your friends to a fun battle of wits.

 This Project is based on:

~ Interacting with the user in the terminal

~ Improving the usability of the Application

~ Refactor the Application to continuously improvement.

~ Storing data in dedicated data files.

  This Quiz Application is a comprehensive project for anyone comfortable with the basics of Python. It is a terminal application that can quiz you and your friends on a range of topics.
You first choose a topic for your questions. Then, for each question, you’ll choose an answer from a set of alternatives. Some questions may have multiple correct answers. After answering a question, you’ll read an explanation that can provide more context for the answer.


                           - Project Overview

I started by creating a basic Python Quiz Application that is only capable of asking a question, collecting an answer, and checking whether the answer is correct. From there, I proceeded to add more and more features in order to make your app more interesting, user-friendly, and fun.

 I build the Quiz Application iteratively by going through the following steps:

~ Create a basic application that can ask multiple-choice questions.
~ Make the app more user-friendly by improving how it looks and how it handles user errors.
~ Refactor the code to use functions.
~ Separate question data from source code by storing questions in a dedicated data file.
~ Expand the app to handle multiple correct answers, give hints, and provide explanations.
~ Add interest by supporting different quiz topics to choose from.
As you follow along, you’ll gain experience in starting with a small script and expanding it. This is an important skill in and of itself. Your favorite program, app, or game probably started as a small proof of concept that later grew into what it is today.


                             - Prerequisites 

In this Project, I build a quiz application using Python’s basic building blocks. While working through the steps, it’s helpful if you’re comfortable with the following concepts:
~ Reading input from the user at the terminal
~ Organizing data in structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries
~ Using if statements to check different conditions
~ Repeating actions with for and while loops
~ Encapsulating code with functions
If you’re not confident in your knowledge of these prerequisites, then that’s okay too! In fact, going through this Project will help you practice these concepts.
